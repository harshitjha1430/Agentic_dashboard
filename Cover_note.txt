Cover Note: Agentic Dashboard Submission

This dashboard presents a mock analysis of key performance indicators (KPIs) for the Agentic Platform — an AI-powered, no-code app builder aimed at enabling non-developers to create functional and aesthetic apps effortlessly. The goal is to demonstrate momentum, usability, and creative engagement via three core metrics:

1)Active Builders (AB): Indicates core user engagement and growing adoption of the platform.
2)Average Time to Publish: Measures the ease of use and user flow — lower times suggest a smoother experience.
3)% of Apps with Custom Aesthetics: Reflects user creativity and how well the platform supports the "vibe coding" vision.

I used line charts with trend lines and forecasts for Active Builders and Publish Time to visualize growth and usability improvements over time. A reference band was added to the time chart to highlight the ideal publishing window. The aesthetic usage metric is displayed via a bar chart, showing increased creative expression over time.

Assumptions made:
1)Data is fabricated for illustrative purposes.
2)Trends are assumed to continue as adoption increases.
3)The ideal publish time range is derived from minimum and average values in the dataset.

This dashboard and insights aim to support a data-driven pitch for the Agentic Platform’s traction and user value.
